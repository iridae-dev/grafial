//! Language bindings module (placeholder for future implementation).
//!
//! This module will provide language bindings for using Baygraph from other
//! languages, including:
//! - Python bindings via PyO3
//! - C FFI interface
//! - WebAssembly bindings
//!
//! The Python bindings will expose the core API for parsing, validating,
//! and executing Baygraph programs from Python code.
//!
//! Currently a placeholder for Phase 0.
