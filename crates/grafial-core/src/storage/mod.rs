//! Storage and persistence module (placeholder for future implementation).
//!
//! This module will provide interfaces for persisting belief graphs and
//! loading evidence data, including:
//! - Graph serialization/deserialization
//! - Evidence loading from various formats (JSON, CSV, etc.)
//! - Checkpoint/restore functionality
//! - Distributed storage backends
//!
//! Currently a placeholder for Phase 0.
